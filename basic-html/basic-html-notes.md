- There are few elements that are consided self closing

<Doctype html>
    ```

    ```html 
    <html lang='en></html>
    ```

        The HTML tags tells the browser that is root of the HTML


    ```html
    <title>Basic HTml Lesson</title>
    ```
    Tile element tells the browser to display what is in between the tags in the tab or browser window
